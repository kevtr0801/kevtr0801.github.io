### Introduction

Welcome to my data projects portfolio! I'm a passionate data analyst student who has honed my skills through self-driven projects and continuous learning. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science to help deepened my understanding and expertise in the field. My journey in data science began with a strong interest in uncovering insights from data, and I've since dedicated my time to mastering various aspects of the discipline, including machine learning, data visualization, time series forecasting, and data wrangling.
